Oracle has been an early adopter of the TrenchBoot project and has been
actively working to productize this technology. One of the key requirements of
any shippable product is the ability to do an in-field upgrade. In this
presentation, members of the Oracle TrenchBoot team will discuss their changes
to grub, the Linux kernel and u-root, present a solution for performing
upgrades, and provide the current development status.
